## Introduction
Welcome to the public repository of vocabularies of the Geological Survey of Western Australia (GSWA). This repository contains vocabularies approved for display on the Web.

The vocabularies listed here are GSWAâ€™s indexes for internal and external use. They cover a wide range of geological, scientific and administrative themes. It aims to build a controlled geoscience vocabulary for GSWA that includes unified, standardised and externally
aligned terminology defining the key scientific terms, relationships and actions that underpin our data/systems.

Each individual vocabulary includes:
 - a concept scheme defining the theme of the vocabulary, with provenance notes
 - a hierarchical list of concepts (or preferred labels), with alternate labels and notations where applicable
 - for each concept, a definition describing the term as it is used by the geological community, together with notes about provenance and links to the main sources consulted
 - if applicable, collections that represent meaningful groupings of terms
 - static Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) that uniquely identify both the concept scheme and individual concepts.

## Technical information

### Publication procedure

GSWA uses a committee system to determine what vocabularies it would like to create or repurpose from elsewhere. Subject matter experts usually assembles the basis of a vocabulary using an Excel template tool, [VocExel](https://tools.dev.kurrawong.ai/vocexcel), which converts Excel workbooks to technical data. The technical data is then sent to this repository which validates it and, if successful, automatically loads it for publication at:

* [GSWA's vocabulary website](https://vocabulary.gswa.kurrawong.ai/v/vocab)

The final publication step is for a persistent web identifier to be allocated to a vocabulary via the Australian Government Linked Data Working Group (<https://www.linked.data.gov.au/>).

### Publication tool

The system used to present vocabularies online is the free [Prez](https://docs.kurrawong.ai/prez/Overview) tool.
