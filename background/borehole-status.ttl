The extent of seal may vary from just plugged near the surface (e.g., many coal boreholes) to plugged to prevent the migration of oil, gas, water or other substance from one stratum to another (PPDM definition, cited by Geoscience Australia, 2021). The surface infrastructure has been removed unless it has been approved to be left in situ (e.g., a well head) and the borehole/well site has been fully remediated/rehabilitated. This status is assigned by the regulatory authority when the permanent sealing and rehabilitation/remediation criteria have been met.
