    schema:description """This vocabulary is a re-published and only marginally changed version of the Registry Ontology's (http://epimorphics.com/public/vocabulary/Registry.html) *Status* vocabulary (online in RDF: http://purl.org/linked-data/registry). The only real change to content has been the addition of the term `unstable`. This re-publication has been performed to allow the IRIs of each vocab term (skos:Concept) to resolve to both human-readable and machine-readable forms of content (HTML and RDF), using HTTP content negotiation.

Note that just like the original form of this vocabulary, while it is a SKOS vocabulary implemented as a single skos:ConceptScheme, it is also an OWL Ontology and that each *Status* is both a skos:Concept and a reg:Status individual.""" ;
