Physiographic provinces distinguish major physiographic changes across the country and are compiled by grouping regions with similar landforms and geological characteristics at a scale of 1: 2.5M. The onshore Australian continent is divided into 23 physiographic provinces, in turn subdivided into several smaller physiographic regions. Each physiographic province is identified by a name, a text description, and a three-digit aggregate code that includes the parent physiographic division code as the first digit (e.g. 301, 302, etc.); this is converted to a five-digit code for database purposes (i.e. 30100, 30200, etc.) to allow better characterization when including physiographic regions.

The onshore Australian continent is divided into 220 physiographic regions. Each region is identified by a name, a text description, and a five-digit aggregate code incorporating the notation of the parent physiographic division and province (e.g. 30100, where 3 represents the division, 301 the province, and 30100 the region).

    skos:definition """Characterization of the type of physiographic units used by the Geological Survey of Western Australia for mapping regolith and landforms in the State. A physiographic units is defined as 'A named geomorphological entity with internal coherence in its landform characteristics and landform evolutionary history. At the lowest levels, physiographic units reflect the underlying geology and have similar groupings of regolith materials that are related to the landform types, their evolution, and the underlying bedrock.' Physiographic unit types are based on the classification of Pain et al. (2011)* whereby three hierarchical types of units are identified for mapping at different scales. The list of identified units is compiled in a companion vocabulary — Australian physiographic units.
