:albite-epidote-hornfels
    a skos:Concept ;
    rdfs:isDefinedBy cs: ;
    skos:definition "A metamorphic facies representing low to moderate temperatures and low or very low pressures, with temperature lower than the hornblende hornfels facies and pressure lower than the greenschist facies. Metabasic rocks are represented by the assemblage albite–epidote–actinolite–chlorite–quartz, analogous to that of the greenschist facies. Metapelitic rocks exhibit the association of muscovite–biotite–chlorite–quartz, analogous to the greenschist facies. The distinction between the greenschist and albite–epidote facies is textural — undeformed hornfels versus foliated schists — rather than mineralogical. It should be noted, though, that although traditionally defined as undeformed, hornfels facies rocks exhibiting deformation features have been documented in the geological record. The facies corresponds to temperatures of about 300–450 °C at pressures less than about 2 kbar. It is typical of metamorphism in the outer parts of contact aureoles, under ultrahigh (geo)thermal gradient and heat flow conditions. Numerous studies do not give facies status to albite-epidote hornfels."@en ;

Amphibolite facies mineral assemblages in metabasic rocks are represented by hornblende–plagioclase, the plagioclase being oligoclase–andesine or more calcic varieties (Eskola, 1939), with epidote and almandine garnet common. Metapelitic rocks are characterized by diagnostic mineral assemblages containing micas associated with garnet, staurolite, kyanite or sillimanite at higher pressures, and andalusite or cordierite at lower pressures within the facies. Amphibolite facies is typical of regional metamorphism at pressures of about 4.5 – 15kbar and of regional or contact metamorphism at pressures less than about 4.5kbar. Temperatures span the range 450–700 °C, and in situ partial melting of rocks occurs in the upper part of this range (above about 650°C). The facies encompasses moderate to high (geo)thermal gradients and heat flow typical of many tectonic environments, and it is thus is a common metamorphic facies for metamorphosed rocks."@en ;

    skos:definition "A metamorphic facies diagnostic of high-pressure (>2 GPa), low-temperature (<500 °C) metamorphism of mafic rocks. Mafic rocks at blueschist facies are represented by combinations of the diagnostic sodic amphibole (e.g. glaucophane, crossite) and lawsonite, sodic pyroxene, aragonite, epidote, and garnet. The mineral pair jadeite–quartz is also diagnostic. Blueschist facies metasiliciclastic rocks may contain diagnostic mineral assemblages involving carpholite, chloritoid, talc, kyanite and phengitic white mica. The facies represents lower temperatures and higher pressures than the greenschist and prehnite–pumpelleyite facies, lower pressures than eclogite facies, and temperatures less than the amphibolite facies (less than about 500°C). At depths indicative of blueschist facies, lower temperatures are not realised in Earth. Blueschist facies metamorphism is associated with tectonic environments in which rocks experience near isothermal compression followed by near isothermal decompression, such as at subduction zones (i.e. unusually low (geo)thermal gradients and heat flow). The term blueschist can also be used as a rock type, so when used as a facies name, the facies context should be made clear (i.e. blueschist-facies rock)."@en ;

Metabasic rocks are represented by omphacitic pyroxene and almandine–pyrope garnet, and lawsonite in the coolest rocks. Also common, but not essential, is the association pyrope–olivine–diopside–enstatite. At ultra-high pressures (minimum 28kbar at 600°C), coesite, diamond or majoritic garnet occur in metabasic rocks. Metapelitic rocks are not typically reported as having recorded eclogite-facies conditions and therefore diagnostic mineral assemblages are not reported for them. The facies represents the highest pressures possible for metamorphism in Earth's crust and upper mantle. It occurs to higher pressure than the blueschist, amphibolite and granulite facies (approximately >15kbar), and over a broad range of temperatures (approximately >500°C).

At the highest temperatures, diagnostic minerals are sapphirine and osumilite in Mg-rich metasiliciclastic rocks. The presence of leucosomes due to in situ partial melting is common. The facies occurs at higher temperature than the amphibolite facies. The facies is typical of regional or high-temperature contact metamorphism at pressures of about 2–17kbar in excess of about 700–750°C.

    skos:definition "A metamorphic facies is defined by a repeatedly occurring and thus predictable set of stable mineral assemblages in metamorphic rocks. Such metamorphic mineral assemblages crystallize and are stable over a range of externally imposed physical conditions, most crucially lithostatic pressure and temperature, and thus the facies define areas in two-dimensional plots of pressure–temperature space. There is a demonstrable/proven relationship between mineral composition and bulk rock chemical composition and a consistent relationship through geological time. Rocks which contain certain metamorphic mineral assemblages can therefore be linked to particular tectonic settings, times and places in the geological history of an area. The boundaries between facies are typically gradational as the disappearance or appearance of minerals occurs over pressure, temperature, space and time. The vocabulary is based on Fettes and Desmons (2007, Metamorphic Rocks: a classification and glossary of terms — Recommendations of the International Union of Geological Sciences Subcommission on the Systematics of Metamorphic Rocks edited by D Fettes and J Desmons, 244p.), with further subdivisions for some facies. Definitions also borrow from Neuendorf et al. (2005, Glossary of Geology: 5th edition, revised edited by KKE Neuendorf, JP Mehl Jr and JA Jackson: American Geological Institute, Alexandria, Virginia, USA, 779p.).
