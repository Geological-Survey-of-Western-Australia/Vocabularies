Although a large proportion of drilling is carried out in the pursuit of mineral and energy resources, core logging is also a critical component of other investigations (e.g. stratigraphic, geotechnical, etc.)."@en ;

Typically, a reservoir analysis incorporates interpretation of depositional facies and diagenesis, mineralogical and textural maturity parameters obtained from macro/meso (e.g. cores, sidewall cores, cuttings) and micro (e.g. thin sections, scanning electron microscope work) samples, as well as direct and indirect measurements of porosity, permeability and grain density from well log analysis and core and mechanical sidewall cores. Image logs are used to determine fracture density where applicable. Regional reservoir distribution and thickness is derived from multiple well reservoir data, seismic interpretation and depth mapping."@en ;

There is considerable overlap with the fields of ecology, evolutionary biology, microbiology, paleontology, and particularly soil science and biogeochemistry. Geobiology applies the principles and methods of biology, geology and soil science to the study of the ancient history of the co-evolution of life and Earth as well as the role of life in the modern world. Geobiological studies tend to be focused on micro-organisms, and on the role that life plays in altering the chemical and physical environment of the pedosphere, which exists at the intersection of the lithosphere, atmosphere, hydrosphere and/or cryosphere. It differs from biogeochemistry in that the focus is on processes and organisms over space and time rather than on global chemical cycles."@en ;

Traditionally, urban planning followed a top-down approach in master planning the physical layout of human settlements, with a primary focus on public welfare (i.e. considerations of efficiency, sanitation, protection and use of the environment) as well as effects of the master plans on the social and economic activities.
